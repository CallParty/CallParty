The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to CallParty. In short we use Github Issues to keep track of bugs and features and accept Pull Requests from anyone who would like to contribute. 

## Submitting Issues
You can create an issue [here](https://github.com/mhfowler/CallParty/issues).

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a github issue requesting a test bot and one of the maintainers will provide you with a test bot and a connection string to connect to the staging database 
3. Follow the instructions in README to get your local development environment and test bot up and running
4. Look through the open issues on the repository
5. Assign yourself to an issue that you want to work on so that others know you are working on it 
6. Follow the JavaScript coding style by using an IDE plugin and our .eslint files
7. Use short, present tense commit messages. See [Commit Message Styleguide](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages).
8. Create a pull request with your changes
9. Once your pull request is approved by two of the maintainers it will be merged into master 🌚
